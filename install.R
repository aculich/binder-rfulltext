install_github("ropensci/fulltext")

#### Add above because @ck37 (Chris Kennedy) recommends:
####   I’d use the github version, which is often more
####   up-to-date anyway: https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext

#### Below may become no longer installable because:
####    Package ‘fulltext’ was removed from the CRAN repository
####    and archived on 2021-11-22 for policy violation.
# install.packages("fulltext")
